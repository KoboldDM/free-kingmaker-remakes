This pack contains free Remakes of Paizo's original work in the Kingmaker Adventure Path, currently up to level 10. This part of the project is discontinued, as the official foundry module from Paizo now has remakes of all maps included. However, I will still be updating the remakes bundle with Companion Quest maps from now on! All scenes have overhead mapping, walling, lighting, and there's quite a few with interactive tiles as well!

Note: Wall Height is a seldom used, but required module for some important scenes. Make sure to download it at least for the Stag Lord's Fort!
The Levels module also has use at the Varnhold Blockhouse.
