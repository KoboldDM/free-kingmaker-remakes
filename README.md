This pack contains free Remakes of Paizo's original work in the Kingmaker Adventure Path, currently up to level 9. All scenes have overhead mapping, walling, lighting, and there's quite a few with interactive tiles as well!

v2.5 is the last release compatible with v10, having up to lvl 8 maps. Unfortunately V11 compendiums are not backwards compatible.

Note: Wall Height is a seldom used, but required module for some important scenes. Make sure to download it at least for the Stag Lord's Fort!
